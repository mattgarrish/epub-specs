            <section>
                <h3>Annotating a textual section</h3>
                <p>
                    A user decides to annotate a textual section of an EPUB. She
                    selects the section, triggers the annotation affordance,
                    optionally enters a note, selects a highlight mode and
                    color. She then saves the annotation. The selected section
                    appears on the page with the chosen highlight.
                </p>
            </section>

                <h3>Annotating an image</h3>
                <p>
                    A user decides to annotate an image of an EPUB. He selects
                    the image and triggers the annotation affordance. The
                    annotation feature is then identical to the one associated
                    with a textual selection.

                <h3>Annotation parts of an image</h3>
                <p>
                    A user consults an EPUB publication that includes detailed
                    diagrams (e.g., in SVG) and images (e.g., in JPG or PNG)
                    visualizing a research data set. She analyses the data by
                    annotating <em>parts</em> of the diagrams and/or images by
                    selecting rectangular areas of the data visualization and
                    shares these annotations with her colleagues.

            <h2>Formatting annotations</h2>
            <p>
                A user adds an annotation to an EPUB. He adds some formatting to
                the text of the annotation: emphasize, italic, underline,
                subtitles.

            <h2>Bookmarking</h2>
            <p>
                A user decides to bookmark a location in a reflowable EPUB. The
                cursor is located where the user clicks on the screen, or at a
                default location (often the top-left corner of the screen, for
                left-to-right content). The user triggers the bookmark
                affordance, optionally selects a highlight mode & color, and
                saves the bookmark. A bookmark icon appears on the page, near
                the line where the cursor was positioned when the bookmark was
                created.

				<h3>Publishing a book with annotations</h3>
            	<p>
	                A famous author annotates a book she has just written, and deals
	                with his publisher a specific edition of the EPUB version of the
	                book which includes these annotations. Readers buy this highly
	                marketed edition, open it with a reading system that supports
	                this specification, and benefit from the author's notes.

				<h3>Exporting a book with annotations</h3>
            	<p>
	                A user exports from a reading system an EPUB he has previously
	                annotated. He decides to save his annotations and bookmarks in
	                the EPUB package. If he imports the ebook into another reading
	                system that supports this specification, annotations and
	                bookmarks automatically appear.
	            </p>

				<h3>Annotations used in the publishing workflow</h3>
            	<p>
	                A copy-editor verifies an EPUB before publication. She opens the
	                EPUB in a reading system that supports this specification,
	                annotates text containing typos and images with missing
	                descriptions. She exports his set of annotations on a destination
	                folder with a specific file name, and provides the file to the
	                EPUB creator. The EPUB creator associates the annotation set
	                with the EPUB file in an editing tool that supports this
	                specification, goes through the annotations, and corrects the
	                EPUB.

				<h3>Annotation used in the classroom</h3>
            	<p>
	                A teacher reads an ebook and prepares some annotations. He adds
	                a keyword to each annotation so that students can group them
	                easily; examples of keywords include “clarification”,
	                “question”, and “interpretation” (1). He exports an annotation
	                file and shares this file with his students. His name (or
	                nickname) is attached to each annotation. The students import
	                the ebook, and then the detached annotation file into their
	                reading application. The annotations made by the teacher appear
	                in the ebook. Students can add their annotations to the ebook
	                and send them back to the teacher.

            <h2>Synchronizing annotations and bookmarks</h2>
				<section>
					<h3>Synchronizing annotation among devices</h3>
					<p>
						A user annotates an EPUB. She synchronizes her annotations and
						bookmarks with her other personal devices via a standardized
						Cloud mechanism supported by each of these systems.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Sharing annotations among readers</h3>
					<p>
		                Participants to a book club read the same EPUB ebook during a
		                period of time, in a reading system that supports this
		                specification. Each participant adds notes to the book, and
		                these annotations are shared via a standardized Cloud mechanism
		                supported by their reading system. The name of each participant
		                appears, so that each participant can see who made which
		                annotation.

            <h2>Surviving versioning</h2>
            <p>
                A user has annotated a textual section of an EPUB and closed the
                ebook. Today, he loads a new version of the EPUB in his reading
                system. The spine item in which the annotations were created has
                been modified, and some words have been added to the leaf HTML
                element in which an annotation was created, before the start of
                the annotation and in the annotated text itself. Still, the user
                gets the annotation at the proper location.
            </p>
            <p>
                The same user loads a new edition of the EPUB in his reading
                system. A new resource - a foreword - has been added to the
                spine, and the page list has been modified. Still, the user gets
                the annotation at the proper location.
